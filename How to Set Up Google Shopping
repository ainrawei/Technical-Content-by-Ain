Pro tips

1. When you setup your budget for Google ads, please ensure that your AVAcredit balance is sufficient. You need at least AVA 3,000 in order to use this feature.
2. This is because you are required to spend AVA 100 per day for Google Ads and your ads will run for 30 days (AVA100 x 30 days = AVA 3,000)
3. You can topup your AVAcredit using AVApay balance or manual payment.
