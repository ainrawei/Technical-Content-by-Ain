Pro-tips

1. For Whatsapp Rotator, it will work correctly if you activate both Whatsapp Commerce and Whatsapp Rotator in the dashboard.
2. If you have set up more than one Customer Service number for Whatsapp Rotator but the message is sent by only one number, this is because once the customer created order by clicking Order through Whatsapp, the customer’s number keyed in by the customer will be served by the same Customer Service number that previously served the customer.
